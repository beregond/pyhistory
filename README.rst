Package to help maintaining HISTORY file for Python project.

* Free software: BSD license

Note
----

This package is created to help maintaining history file in environment of high
concurrency (literally: each pull request on GitHub had conflicts in
HISTORY.rst file because it was updated before creating PR). Take into account
it may NOT fit into your environment and/or workflow since it was cutted for
specific case, but it's good if so. :)
